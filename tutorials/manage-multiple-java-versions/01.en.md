## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to install, configure, and switch between multiple Java versions on an Ubuntu VPS. This guide provides step-by-step instructions that help you set up your environment to run different Java applications or test code against various Java versions. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, the instructions here are detailed enough to assist you every step of the way.

**Prerequisites**

- A VPS running Ubuntu (tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and later).
- A non-root user with sudo privileges.
- Basic familiarity with the command line.

## Step 1 - Update Your System

Before installing any new software, ensure your system is up-to-date.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
```

These commands update the package list and install the software-properties-common package, which is useful for managing repositories.

## Step 2 - Install Multiple Java Versions

Ubuntu offers several Java versions via OpenJDK. In this tutorial, we will install OpenJDK 8, 11, and optionally 17.

### Step 2.1 - Install OpenJDK 8

Execute the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk -y
```

### Step 2.2 - Install OpenJDK 11

Install OpenJDK 11 with:

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
```

### Step 2.3 - (Optional) Install OpenJDK 17

If you need the latest version, install OpenJDK 17:

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
```

## Step 3 - Configure Java Alternatives

Ubuntu uses the update-alternatives system to manage multiple versions of the same software. This tool lets you switch the default Java version easily.

### Step 3.1 - Register Installed Java Versions

Register each Java version with the following commands. The number at the end represents the priority (a higher number gives higher priority by default):

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/java 1081
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java 1111
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/bin/java 1711
```

### Step 3.2 - Switch Between Java Versions

To select the active Java version, run:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

A prompt will list all registered Java versions. Enter the selection number corresponding to the version you wish to use.

### Step 3.3 - Verify the Active Java Version

Confirm your selection by checking the Java version:

```bash
java -version
```

This command displays the version currently in use.

## Step 4 - Manage the Java Compiler (javac)

It is essential to ensure that the Java compiler matches your selected runtime environment.

### Step 4.1 - Register Installed Java Compilers

Register the javac executables for all installed Java versions:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/javac 1081
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/javac 1111
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/bin/javac 1711

```

### Step 4.2 - Switch the Java Compiler

Select the default compiler using:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config javac
```

Then verify with:

```bash
javac -version
```

## Step 5 - Set the JAVA_HOME Environment Variable

Many applications require the JAVA_HOME environment variable to be set correctly.

### Step 5.1 - Edit Your Shell Profile

Open your profile file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 5.2 - Add the JAVA_HOME Variable

Append the following lines at the end of the file. Adjust the path to the version you want to set as default (here, Java 11 is used):

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

Save the file and exit the editor.

### Step 5.3 - Apply the Changes

Load the new settings:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 5.4 - Verify JAVA_HOME

Ensure that the environment variable is set:

```bash
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

It should output the path you defined.

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to manage multiple Java versions on an Ubuntu VPS by installing various OpenJDK versions and configuring them using update-alternatives. You learned to switch between different Java environments and set the JAVA_HOME variable for consistency across applications. This setup is invaluable for testing and deploying applications that require specific Java versions.
